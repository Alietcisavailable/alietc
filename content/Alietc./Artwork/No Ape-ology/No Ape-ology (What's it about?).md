’No Ape-ology’ is a new project that seeks to shed light on the myriad challenges confronting individuals in contemporary society, including but not limited to the impact of poverty, homelessness, crime, and the prevalence of mental and physical health issues. Through the ingenious use of apes as a medium, the project endeavours to offer a fresh and accessible perspective on these pressing issues, employing humour as a tool to engage and connect with a wide audience. By leveraging the relatable and endearing nature of apes, the project aspires to foster a greater understanding of these challenges and spark meaningful conversations around them. Through its unique and engaging approach, the project aims to serve as a catalyst for positive change, empathy, and awareness in society.
