Ah, my GP, the benevolent overlord of 8-minute consultations. Where else can you experience the thrilling rush of summarizing all your ailments faster than a contestant on Mastermind?


Visiting Dr. Ballard is less like a routine medical check-up and more like embarking on a journey to uncover the hidden treasures of one’s own mortality.

Dr. Ballard greeted me with the enthusiasm of a man who’s spent the last three hours debating whether he should have become an investment banker instead. 

The consultation began with the obligatory "How are you feeling?"—a question to which I foolishly replied honestly.

In summary, Dr. Ballard’s consultation was an unforgettable blend of bewilderment, mild terror, and reluctant gratitude. While I can’t confidently say I left his office healthier, I did leave with a newfound appreciation for the absurdity of the human condition.
